# CHANGELOG

### 5.1.0
 - Removed functions used to crop, resize and watermark images. Image manipulation is no longer supported

### 5.0.0 
 - Compatibility with PHP8+

### 4.0.0
 - I'm not going to lie, most changes were done to get the perfect scrutinizer code quality
 - Also removed getting errors with `$image['error']` use `$image->getError()` instead
 - PHPunit requirement is ^6 - so tests for < php7.0 won't work (sorry)
 - Trying to upload images less or equal than 2px (width/height) is not longer prevented.
   Honestly, who am I to judge how many pixels an image should be?
 - Code is more refractored, it should be ready to eat now
